# giphy

Created a program that allows users to search terms in a form and then dynamically creates buttons. These buttons can then be used to pull gifs from giphy.com that are originally static. When clicked the gifs will become animated and can be clicked again to restore them to their static posiion.

If you are trying this yourself it is important to use a click handler on the gifs that works on dynamic elements for when you are trying to get them to switch from static to animated.
